## Vision Statement

This game is for teens/young adults who enjoy FPS games. This game, is an arena style FPS
that is quick and easy to play with friends. Unlike games like Fortnite/CS:GO, our game does not
have a steep learning curve. Anyone can be good at this game in a few times playing. Our games offer
a simple arena with lanes, walls, and players spawning in different corners. The objective of the game
is to be the last man standing.
